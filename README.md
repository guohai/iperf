Here based on 2.0.5 to port it on Android platform


Suppose you have full AOSP downloaded.


* untar iperf-2.0.5.tar.gz to $PATH/TO/AOSP/external/iperf-2.0.5
* copy Android.mk to $PATH/TO/AOSP/external/iperf-2.0.5
* source build/envsetup.sh
* lunch // choose what you like
* mmm external/iperf-2.0.5


You should have it done.

Good Luck~~
